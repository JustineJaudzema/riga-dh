###The use of digital methods for analysing folk legends about immured

Digital humanities is an interdisciplinary area of scholarly activity where digital
technologies and humanities are combined. The use of computational methods for research
has been a big part of humanities in past few decades all over the world. Unfortunately, in
Latvia, using digital methods in research is not as common, although the environment for
such a research is widely developed â€“ books, newspapers and archival materials are
available in digital format.
This work combines information about the history and methodological aspects of
digital humanities and shows example of using digital methods for legend analysis. The
aim of this study is to discover the geographical dissemination of legends about immured,
connections between storytellers and collectors, and to do a textual analysis of some of the
texts by using methods of digital humanities.
Methods of digital humanities is a way of working quantitative data analysis, making
visualizations and in that way allowing to see material from a different perspective. Using
this approach allows to discover unseen patterns in the study of folklore materials and has
a potential in other fields of cultural heritage.
